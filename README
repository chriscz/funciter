Functional Wrapper for iterators and iterables in python.

Description
-----------

When creating a FunctionalIterable if you back
it with a iterator, then it can only be used once.

However, if you back it with a list, tuple or other form
of iterable collection, then reuse is possible.

When invoking any of the api functions, a new FunctionalIterable
is returned, therefore one can chain several operations.

Extension
-----------
Users that extend the FunctionalIterator class should override
the `_iterable` property and either return a generator or an iterator.
